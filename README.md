# Notes


## Pictures

There is a tight constraint if you want the picture to fill entirely its emplacement.
I made every picture div respect the golden ratio.

| sizes (px) | width | height |
|:----------:|------:|-------:|
|    cover   | 1100  |  680   |
|    card    |  720  |  445   |


If you don't want it to take the full width, the picture will be scaled to be seen in its entirety.
In this case, please use `png` files, and make sure they have an alpha channel (transparency).


## Text

The long text fields, namely `cover.content` and `categories[i].cards[j].description`
support html tags so you can insert links and use custom formatting.

The page is made to show pinpointed skills, and therefore should contain few text.
Please try to limit the text fields to the following:
*Keep in mind that it changes relative to the numbers of `i` you use :clap:*

|     field name     | max #characters |
|:------------------:|----------------:|
|    `cover.title`   |            ~12  |
|   `cover.content`  |              âˆž  |
|     `card.title`   |            ~14  |
| `card.description` |           ~256  |
